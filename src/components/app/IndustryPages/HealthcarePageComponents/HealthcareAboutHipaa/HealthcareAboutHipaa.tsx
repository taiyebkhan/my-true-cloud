          <p>
            HIPAA stands for the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
            Act. HIPAA is a federal guideline that aims to ensure that patient
            information and records are protected and maintain their integrity.
            HIPAA consists of three parts; a transactions element that is
            designed to get users to submit claims in a specific electronic
            manner rather than on paper. A privacy element that is designed to
            protect patientsâ€™ medical details. And lastly, a security element to
            make sure unauthorized persons cannot access the data.
